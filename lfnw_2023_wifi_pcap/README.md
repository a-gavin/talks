# Wireless Packet Capture on Linux
Materials used for a WiFi packet capture talk I did at LinuxFest Northwest's 2023 Minifest.

In addition to [slides](./slides.pdf), there is also an [accompanying guide](./GUIDE.md) and [Python script](./list_interfaces.py). The guide details the necessary steps to manually configure WiFi packet capture on Linux using `iw` and Wireshark. The Python script is a utility that automates a couple of steps as you determine the correct radio you will use for packet capture (details in the guide).
